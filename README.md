First, go to `Configuration.py` and set the ip to `0.0.0.0` and the port to `9339`. For local use of the server. 

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`python lib.py`__ then __`python Core.py`__

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. 
Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/RCcQgLhC#pAYethGveBwGtWzYio6pyux-KQq2QInQg-SYn_ZRhpw) and change the IP in `libprojectbsds.config.so`, if you want to use BSDS locally on your device, you can use "127.0.0.1" as the IP. If not, then you can use your device's IPv4 address. 

#### The APK was recently updated to support Android 12+ and Emulators.
